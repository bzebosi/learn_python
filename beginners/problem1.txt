""" Python Problem:
You have an amount of money in cents, for example 67 cents. Write a Python program that figures out how many quarters (25¢), dimes (10¢), nickels (5¢), and pennies (1¢) make up that amount, using the fewest number of coins possible.

Your program should:

Start with a variable amount (in cents).

Use integer division (//) and modulo (%) to find out how many of each coin fits into the amount.

Print out the number of quarters, dimes, nickels, and pennies.
